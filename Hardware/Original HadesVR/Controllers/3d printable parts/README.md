# 3D printable parts notes:

  - All parts print without any support material
  - 0.1mm layers recommended
  - You **might** need to enlarge the SYS button hole slightly
  - You'll need to carefully glue the TP4056 in place without getting glue in the usb connector
  - *The 3d printed clips **will most likely snap***, this will get fixed soonâ„¢, In the meantime superglue will do
